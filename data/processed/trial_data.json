Additional knowledge routes human exposure e.g. mosquito bites contact infected animal products affect immune response disease outcomes required . enhance global efforts preparing for, preventing, spread RVF disease regions. RVF under-diagnosed febrile illness ECA region occurrence unknown undiagnosed infectious diseases. clinical disease variety pathogens humans animals missed settings health care access limited diagnostics scarce. Notably, multiple studies region report levels hospital visits, marginalized communities, including remote rural arid lands health facilities functioning transport infrastructure discourages traveling distances access health care. suspected infectious diseases humans undiagnosed considerable testing carried out; thus, retrospective studies emerging pathogens uncover region occurred pathogen identified epidemics reported. HYPOTHESIS OBJECTIVES Hypothesis Goal hypothesis RVF virus, maintained cryptic vertebrate-mosquito cycling inter-epidemic periods substantial public health burden. goal determine public health threat posed RVF virus IEPs East Central Africa region identify potential opportunities prevention control strategies reduce likelihood major outbreaks. Primary objectives (i) Determine low-level RVF virus transmission disease animals humans occurs inter-epidemic periods (IEPs) (ii) Conduct detailed niche modelling RVF risk risk ecologies determine ecological risk factors persistence RVF virus recurrence outbreaks animals humans (iii) Investigate impact climate change RVF permissive ecologies RVF virus transmission Secondary objective (iv) Conduct pathogen discovery human, livestock, wildlife samples collected ECA countries identify circulating emerging infectious pathogens epidemic pandemic potential.

(i) Tana river, Marsabit, Isiolo Murangá counties Kenya (ii) Kabale, Rubanda Isingiro districts Uganda (iii) North South Kivu provinces DRC (iv) 4 countries emerging RVF hotspot STUDY PROCEDURES 1. outpatient health facility-based studies: conduct 2-year hospital-based study determine burden RVF infections humans, risk factors infection, severity disease IEPs. sample size 707-1,500 human participants recruited 2 site, based assumptions RVFV seroprevalence. health facility, longitudinal acute febrile illness (AFI) surveillance established. Patients, adults children acute fever reported fever 4 weeks, included prospectively period capture seasonal variability. focus undifferentiated fever, defined clinical disease, example, malaria, acute upper respiratory tract infection urinary tract infection excluded. However, percent samples patients positive malaria rapid diagnostic blood smear included study common risk factors malaria RVF infection. clinical history physical examination clinical officer/nurse on-ground provide clinical manifestation severity illness.

Marsabit site, camels included. start survey, develop sampling frame households study site. provide geographically representative sample, households randomly selected study site. breed animal exotic indigenous captured. Livestock blood samples collected tested RVFV RNA, anti-viral IgM IgG antibodies. household selected field sites included seroprevalence (and sero-conversion) study, link animal, vector human infection. consented household included. participant provide sample serological analysis social behaviour assessed, standard questionnaire - collect contact domestic animals including assisting birth, slaughter, handling hides skins, consuming raw milk blood.

Wildlife sampling: Convenient wildlife sampling carried field sites nearby national conservation Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania DRC. blood/serum samples collected wildlife officers animal disease surveillance and/or translocation; blood/serum tissue samples dead killed wildlife collected. archived samples locations. samples tested RVF RNA antibodies, pathogen discovery detect circulating emerging pathogens. 5. Vector studies: approach investigating role vectors cryptic cycles IEPs guided proportion mosquitoes infected, epidemics. Therefore, identify presence infected mosquitoes interpret acute RVFV infections (presence viral RNA) measure presence infected mosquitoes mosquito-to-vertebrate transmission. acute RVFV infection collect mosquito pools community grazing households livestock sampling, identify species RVFV RNA. difficult establish colonies RVF vectors, Aedes mcintoshi Aedes ochraceus, laboratory studies, carry suitability studies field approaches. First, eggs larvae mosquitoes collected (April - July) short (October - November) rains dambos located elevation field sites Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, DRC geocodes recorded study solonetz, planosol, solonchak, vertisol soil types. Larvae 3rd, 4th stages pupae collected dippers plastic whirl-pack bags transportation (in cool boxes) laboratory. laboratory, immatures reared adults identified morphologically.

Procedures Study visits screening, baseline, weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 48 (with 4-week extension required confirming HIV-1 RNA levels FDA snapshot window). HIV-1 RNA viral load performed screening weeks 4, 12, 24 48. HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/ml repeat performed weeks detectable result confirm virological failure. repeat HIV-1 RNA result ≥ 50 copies/ml confirmed protocol-defined virological failure (PDVF) genotypic resistance testing performed. routine study investigations include CD4, complete blood count, serum Creatinine, Alanine aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, HBsAg, serum glucose, patient satisfaction questionnaires (HIVTSQ), urine pregnancy women child-bearing potential. extenuating circumstances, travel restrictions facility closures risk COVID-19 infection unanticipated events, telephone calls complete CRFs scheduled study visits, arrangements ade laboratory samples subject's home. participant withdraw study time. addition, investigators decide, reasons medical prudence, study medications. participants 48 weeks. participants experience PDVF (two consecutive HIV-1 RNA levels 50 copies/ml 14 days apart), study PI/co-PI informed management recommendations, include genotypic drug resistance testing. Participants attend study visits. Study medication discontinued instances: participant withdraws consent participant requires substitution PI/r DTG drug-drug interactions toxicity. NRTIs allowed clinically indicated, PI/r class (e.g. LPV/r ATV/r) allowed required national supply chain limitations. Dose adjustments required manage drug-drug interactions allowed, product monograph drug investigators subject (i.e. intercurrent illness, unacceptable toxicity) study medication subject fails comply protocol requirements, including poor adherence, fails cooperate investigators female subject receiving DTG pregnant study DTG withdrawn eliminate exposure embryo/foetus. Exceptions discussed Ethics ViiV situations benefits continuing pregnant woman DTG outweigh potential risks. minimize risk subjects, study staff, staff study sites, precautions reduce risk COVID-19 transmission in-line Ministry Health guidelines guidance Ethical Review Committee. Source Dose Products Participants randomized continue pre-enrollment PI/r switch PI/r DTG continuing NRTIs pre-enrollment regimen. NRTIs allowed study period clinical indications. PI/r class allowed (e.g. LPV/r ATV/r) required limitations national supply chain. ARVs participants Kenya national ARV supply change mechanism, generic fixed-dose combinations available. participants randomized switch PI/r+ABC/3TC DTG+ABC/3TC, ViiV provide single-tablet fixed-dose combination DTG/ABC/3TC commercial form Triumeq®. Participants randomized DTG 50 tablet daily, single tablet combination separate fixed-dose combination tablet NRTIs fixed-dose combination DTG 50 NRTIs, national supply change ViiV (in DTG/ABC/3TC). Participants dispensed 4 week supply ARVs baseline, 8 week supply week 4, 12 week supply weeks 12, 24 36. Type Participants anticipated sample size 766 participants (383 study arm). sample size calculation based primary endpoint HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/ml week 48 FDA snapshot method Intent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT-E) population. sample size calculation assumes true difference efficacy treatment arms virological failure rate 3% week 48. total 766 participants (383 participants study arm) required provide 90% power demonstrate non-inferiority DTG arm, compared control arm, one-sided significance level 2.5% non-inferiority margin 4%. Study Location: study sites Kenya include: Kenyatta National Hospital, Thika Level 5 Hospital, Kiambu Level 5 Hospital Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching Referral Hospital."
